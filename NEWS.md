* More kerning work:

  Kerning have been further refined, extended in coverage especially
  between contextual variants, and mysterious dot movements on Windows
  resulting from bad interaction between kerning and dot positioning
  have been fixed.

* Refined dot positioning:

  Some dot placements have been refined, though this area still in need
  of more work.

* Smaller file size:

  The uncompressed TTF file is now approximately 25% smaller than previous
